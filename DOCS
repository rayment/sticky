DOCUMENTATION
-------------

Documentation is generated using the provided Doxyfile and the doxygen program.

The process can be automated by running `make docs' or by manually running
Doxygen with `doxygen Doxyfile'.

Output is generated in the 'docs' folder in both LaTeX (which will also require
compiling) and HTML format.
