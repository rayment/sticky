INSTALL
-------

The following build requirements must be met to compile and install sticky:
  - A C99 compatible C compiler
  - GNU compatible Make
  - Git (for contrib)

The following libraries and headers are also dependencies to install sticky:
  - freetype2
  - GL
  - GLEW
  - OpenAL
  - SDL2

The following libraries are optional and not required to install sticky but will
limit the functionality of the library if not enabled:
  - Assimp
  - OpenMP

Note that the contrib folder contains a build script for some extra external
dependencies. These dependencies are built into the engine automatically and
are not included in the above list.

Toggling optional libraries:
  - Go to the project root directory and edit the ENABLE_XXX variables in
    Makefile where XXX corresponds to an optional library.
  - Follow the below instructions and compile as normal.

Instructions:
  - Go to the contrib folder and run `make' to download and prepare the extra
    external dependencies.
  - Go to the project root directory and run `make' to compile the library.
  - Now run `make install' to install the library and headers.
    Note that admin permissions may be required to run this command.
    The library can still be linked locally.
    Note also that a Unix-like system is most likely required.
  - If your C compiler does not have a system link to `gcc', edit Makefile
    and change the 'CC' variable to the correct command.

Note that if you are installing on a 32-bit operating system, you must change
the 'ARCH' variable to 32 before compilation.

UNINSTALL
---------

The headers are installed by default to:
	/usr/local/include/sticky

The library is installed by default to:
	/usr/local/lib

- These files can be removed by running
  `make uninstall'.
- Otherwise, you may remove these files manually with no negative consequence.
- Note that admin permissions may be required to remove these files.
