sticky - 3D OpenGL engine for C

---------------------------------------------------

sticky is a simple 3D OpenGL engine written in C intended to reduce the
boilerplate OpenGL code that is needed for different projects. The video,
shader, texture, audio and models among other things are all handled by the
engine which allows for much more rapid prototyping and program development.
